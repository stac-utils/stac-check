The values of ELSA vary between 0 and 1 (multiplied by a scale factor of 10000) denoting lowest and highest fragmentation. We use an existing spatially contiguous, global remote-sensing data product (i.e. the 27-year annual ESA CCI land cover maps which can be categorized as an EBV 'Ecosystem Distribution') to derive an annual (27 year) time-series of the Relative Magnitude of Fragmentation (RMF) at a global scale and with a spatial resolution of 300m. From this derived EBV data product, we can calculate a RMF indicator of ecosystem degradation, i.e. the change, and rate of change, in fragmentation of ecosystems (e.g. forests) over the last 27 years. This can provide important information for measuring biodiversity change as it directly links to the draft monitoring framework of the zero draft of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), especially Draft 2050 Goal 1 and the related Draft 2030 Target 1 (see Annex of  the zero draft). We define the 'forest' class by aggregating all 14 tree cover related land cover types from the ESA CCI product into one class. We further define eight non-forest classes (agriculture, grassland, wetland, settlement, sparse vegetation, bare area, water, permanent snow and ice) that we use as multinomial categorical data, or as binary categorical data (to define forest vs. non-forest). This classes follow the reclassification used by Mousivand & Arsanjani 2019 (Applied Geography 106: 82-92). For deriving the RMF, we either calculate ELSA using the binary categorical data (forest vs. non-forest) or the multinomial categorical data (forest vs. the eight non-forest classes).","stac_version":"1.0.0","stac_extensions":[]},{"id":"colombia-human-footprint","type":"Collection","links":[{"rel":"items","type":"application/geo+json","href":"https://stac.geobon.org/collections/colombia-human-footprint/items"},{"rel":"parent","type":"application/json","href":"https://stac.geobon.org/"},{"rel":"root","type":"application/json","href":"https://stac.geobon.org/"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/json","href":"https://stac.geobon.org/collections/colombia-human-footprint"}],"title":"Colombia - Human Footprint","extent":{"spatial":{"bbox":[[-79,-4,-66,12]]},"temporal":{"interval":[["1970-01-01T00:00:00Z","2018-12-31T00:00:00Z"]]}},"license":"CC-BY-NC-4.0","description":"Human Footprint dataset for Colombia for years 1970, 1990, 2000, 2015 and 2018","stac_version":"1.0.0","stac_extensions":[]},{"id":"colombia-protected-areas","type":"Collection","links":[{"rel":"items","type":"application/geo+json","href":"https://stac.geobon.org/collections/colombia-protected-areas/items"},{"rel":"parent","type":"application/json","href":"https://stac.geobon.org/"},{"rel":"root","type":"application/json","href":"https://stac.geobon.org/"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/json","href":"https://stac.geobon.org/collections/colombia-protected-areas"}],"title":"Colombia - Protected Areas","extent":{"spatial":{"bbox":[[-79,-4,-66,12]]},"temporal":{"interval":[["1930-01-01T00:00:00Z","2022-12-31T00:00:00Z"]]}},"license":"CC-BY-NC-4.0","description":"Protected areas of Colombia from 1930 to 2020","stac_version":"1.0.0","stac_extensions":[]},{"id":"earthenv_topography_derived","type":"Collection","links":[{"rel":"items","type":"application/geo+json","href":"https://stac.geobon.org/collections/earthenv_topography_derived/items"},{"rel":"parent","type":"application/json","href":"https://stac.geobon.org/"},{"rel":"root","type":"application/json","href":"https://stac.geobon.org/"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/json","href":"https://stac.geobon.org/collections/earthenv_topography_derived"}],"title":"EarthEnv - Derived topographic categorical variables","extent":{"spatial":{"bbox":[[-180,-60,180,85]]},"temporal":{"interval":[["2010-01-01T00:00:00Z","2010-12-31T00:00:00Z"]]}},"license":"CC-BY-NC-4.0","description":"A fully standardized and global multivariate product of different terrain features to support many large-scale research applications.
